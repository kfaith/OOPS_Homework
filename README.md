# OOPS_Homework
This repository holds all of the homework assignments completed in the Object-Oriented Programming And Data Structures class.

The rest of the homework assignments were also completed, however they were turned in on our schools "grader" software, rather than on canvas, so the ones submitted on the schools automatic grading system are not present in this repository. 

The homework assignments go over many topics such as: Pointers, Linked Lists, Complexity, Shallow/Deep Copies, Templating, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Testing, Recursion, Binary Search Trees, Heap Data Structure, Sorting Algorithms, and Graphs/Graph Traversal.
